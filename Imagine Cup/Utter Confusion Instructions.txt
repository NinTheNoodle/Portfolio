To install Utter Confusion simply run the installer and optionally select an installation folder.
An icon for the game will be added to your desktop and start menu.

Once the game has been installed and is running - use the mouse to operate the menus and press Escape to either go up one menu level or quit.
A back button will also be presented.

The controls in-game are WASD and the left mouse button. The arrow keys are mapped to WASD for the sake of people using a left handed mouse.
The objective of the game is to kill the enemies and collect as much confetti as possible for a high score.

Custom game modes can be created using the in-game editor, either select NEW to add a new game mode or edit an already existing one.
Editing a game mode allows you to set a variety of variables to any stupidly extreme value you want.

This prototype of the game comes with one sample custom game mode and one sample challenge - in a later iteration of the game challenges will be used
to unlock variables to edit for custom game modes. There will also be an options menu with mute and fullscreen controls.
